## How to set up Rapyd for Restaurants Via WhatsApp 

### WhatsApp account 
To use the WhatsApp API, you must have an account with a third-party provider. Out of dozens available, we chose 360dialog. They were responsive and enthusiastic. Website: 360dialog.com. When you are testing, use one mobile phone to function as the restaurant's server and two or more for modeling customer behavior. Each phone must have WhatsApp installed. 

### Development environment 
Use your favorite SDK for your favorite programming language. We used PyCharm for Python. See jetbrains.com. 

### Code repository 
We used Bitbucket. See bitbucket.org. 

### SSH connection 
To access Bitbucket, you need an SSH connection. See
